# FailSafe — Safety layer for AI coding agents

Prevent runaway AI edits, hallucinated dependencies, and destructive refactors before they break your codebase.

FailSafe runs locally inside VS Code and Cursor. It monitors what AI agents do, applies deterministic policy checks at the editor boundary, and gives you full visibility into every decision — before code ships.

**Current Release**: v4.9.5 (2026-03-16)

## What's New in v4.7.0

Agent Marketplace and Microsoft Agent Governance Toolkit integration — discover, install, and manage external agent repositories with HITL security gates and automated vulnerability scanning.

### Added

- **Agent Marketplace** — Skills tab sub-section with curated catalog of 11 external agent repos (AutoResearch, AutoGen, TaskWeaver, PyRIT, Garak, Promptfoo, Dify, and more) across Autonomous, Safety, and UI categories.
- **HITL Security Gates** — Nonce-based approval tokens for installation confirmation with repo URL, author, permissions, and sandbox options.
- **Security Scanner Integration** — Garak/Promptfoo CLI integration for vulnerability scanning with L1/L2/L3 risk grades.
- **Microsoft Agent Governance Toolkit Adapter** — Python package (`agent-failsafe`) bridging FailSafe to agent-os, agent-mesh, agent-hypervisor, and agent-sre.

## What's New in v4.6.6

Workspace isolation and repository governance — multiple VS Code windows can run FailSafe independently, and external workspaces can be validated against governance standards.

### Added

- **Repository Governance as a Service** — Validates workspaces against `REPO_GOVERNANCE.md` standards (structure, root files, GitHub config, commit discipline, security posture) with automated grading (A-F).
- **Compliance metric in Monitor** — Workspace Health grid displays compliance grade with color-coded indicator and violation tooltips.
- **Multi-workspace support** — Server registry tracks active instances; workspace selector in Command Center enables switching between connected workspaces.
- **S.H.I.E.L.D. phase tracker** — Parses META_LEDGER.md to detect current governance phase and provide context-aware next steps.

## What's New in v4.6.5

Cross-agent skill consolidation — all SHIELD skills migrated from legacy `.claude/commands/` to modern `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` format. Agent definitions separated to `.claude/agents/`. ModelAdapter output directories corrected for all 5 supported platforms. VSIX bundling de-complected (skills only, no agents).

### Changed

- **Skills migrated to SKILL.md format** — 17 SHIELD skills + 3 personas now use directory-based `.claude/skills/ql-*/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter, matching modern Claude Code SDK conventions.
- **Agents separated** — 7 agent definitions moved to `.claude/agents/ql-*.md` with subagent frontmatter. Claude Code loads these natively without extension scaffolding.
- **ModelAdapter output dirs fixed** — Claude (`.claude/skills/`), Codex (`.agents/skills/`), Gemini (`.gemini/skills/`), Copilot (`.github/skills/`), Cursor (`.cursor/rules/`) all corrected.
- **getOutputPath simplified** — Directory-based output (`{name}/SKILL.md`) is now the default; only Cursor uses flat files.
- **VSIX bundling de-complected** — Agents removed from bundle patterns, eliminating scaffold collision. Directory-based skill bundling added.
- **Antigravity restructured** — Genesis/Qorelogic directories replaced with `skills/ql-*/SKILL.md` + `agents/` layout.
- **Stale duplicates removed** — `FailSafe/Claude/` (20 files) deleted; 12 quarantined skills cleaned up.
- **Cross-agent instruction file** — `AGENTS.md` created at repo root for Codex/Copilot/Cursor/Windsurf compatibility.

## What's New in v4.6.4

Governance state integrity remediation — trust data that was transient or fabricated is now persisted, verified, and kept in sync.

### Fixes

- **Trust state no longer transient** — Agent trust scores, quarantine status, and verification counts now persist through EventBus-driven cache invalidation. Every trust mutation writes to SQLite and rebuilds the in-memory cache from DB.
- **Trust timestamps are real** — Audit trails reflect actual DB `updated_at` instead of fabricated call-time timestamps.
- **Checkpoint chain verified on startup** — No longer assumes valid. Auto-verifies integrity and flags failures.
- **Version display fixed** — Command Center hub snapshot reads version from package.json (was hardcoded 4.4.0).

### Added

- **Optimistic locking for trust persistence** — Concurrent agent trust writes use version-based concurrency control with automatic retry, preventing silent data loss from race conditions.

### Changed

- **TrustEngine refactored** — 449-line monolith split into TrustEngine (223L), TrustPersistence (167L), and TrustCalculator (40L) for Section 4 Razor compliance.

## What's New in v4.6.3

### Fixes

- **Console Server accessible again** — Fixed latent Express dotfile protection bug that caused 404 errors when extension was installed in dotfile directories (`.vscode/`, `.antigravity/`).
- **Monitor & Command Center Parity** — Build steps, debug sessions, and recently completed items now track live in the sidebar. L3 approval queue auto-prunes expired requests. Command Center surfaces Sentinel critical alerts with verdict banners and status-aware mission strip coloring.

## What's New in v4.6.1

### Fixes

- Missing sidebar icon restored — activity bar now shows the FailSafe shield.
- Release Pipeline no longer fails on tag-based CI runs (detached HEAD).
- Icon validation added to preflight gate to prevent missing asset regressions.

## What's New in v4.6.0

### Section 4 Razor Decomposition

- **ConsoleServer.ts**: 3265L decomposed to 1124L with 5 extracted route modules (Brainstorm, Checkpoint, Actions, TransparencyRisk) and 7 service modules (SkillParser, SkillFrontmatter, SkillRegistry, SkillDiscovery, SkillRanker, CheckpointStore, CheckpointUtils).
- **stt-engine.js**: 400L decomposed to 249L with 4 extracted modules (whisper-loader, silence-timer, wake-word-listener, live-transcriber).
- **EnforcementEngine.ts**: 250L decomposed to 122L with 4 enforcement evaluators (Observe, Assist, Enforce, IntentAutoCreator).

### Voice Brainstorm Fixes

- rAF batching for graph mutations prevents forced reflows during rapid node updates.
- TTS error handling now surfaces actual error messages instead of `[object Object]`.
- Node type taxonomy: Idea, Decision, Task, Constraint with color-coded categories.
- Modal waveform visualizer renders via `onAnalyser` callback.

### Release Tooling & Governance

- Hook toggle UI in Console Settings panel with enable/disable controls.
- Release gate now validates backlog duplicates, version summaries, and help doc markers.
- Governance doc storage consolidated to `.failsafe/governance/` with `/ql-organize` Phase 6 compliance checking.

### Voice-Brainstorm Status

Implemented. Console Mindmap tab supports mic capture, STT/TTS roundtrip, transcript-to-graph extraction, and confidence-based node coloring. Requires vendored Whisper/Piper runtime assets.

### Under the Hood

- Socket.dev compliance: deprecated API removal and post-build pattern sanitization for clean scan scores.
- Circular dependency between SkillRegistry and SkillDiscovery eliminated.
- Operator help docs (`COMPONENT_HELP.md`, `PROCESS_GUIDE.md`) updated to v4.6.0.

## What FailSafe Does

FailSafe separates system awareness from system control.

The Monitor provides real-time visibility into system health, governance posture, and operational risk. The Command Center is the primary control surface for planning, audits, checkpoints, and agent governance.

- Save-time intent gate that can block writes outside an active intent
- Sentinel daemon for file-change audits in `heuristic`, `llm-assisted`, and `hybrid` modes
- SOA ledger with local audit history and checkpoint summaries
- MCP server support for external tools that need audit and ledger hooks

## QoreLogic: The Governance Layer

QoreLogic is the deterministic governance engine that enforces safety policies at the editor boundary. It operates on a fundamental principle: **governance decisions are made by code, not by asking an LLM to follow rules.**

### Prompt Guidelines vs. Deterministic Governance

| Aspect             | Prompt-Based Safety                     | QoreLogic Deterministic Governance   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Decision Maker** | LLM interprets rules                    | TypeScript code executes rules       |
| **Consistency**    | Varies with context, temperature, model | Identical output for identical input |
| **Auditability**   | Opaque reasoning chain                  | Explicit code path, logged decisions |
| **Bypass Risk**    | LLM can ignore or reinterpret           | Code cannot be persuaded             |
| **Speed**          | Network latency + inference             | Sub-millisecond local execution      |

### How QoreLogic Works

1. **Risk Classification** — Files are classified as L1 (low), L2 (medium), or L3 (high) risk based on:
   - File path triggers (e.g., `auth/`, `payment/`, `credential` → L3)
   - Content triggers (e.g., `DROP TABLE`, `api_key`, `private_key` → L3)
   - Configurable via `.failsafe/config/policies/risk_grading.json`

2. **Policy Evaluation** — Each risk grade has deterministic requirements:
   - **L1**: Heuristic check, 10% sampling, auto-approve
   - **L2**: Full Sentinel pass, no auto-approve
   - **L3**: Formal verification + human approval required

3. **Ledger Recording** — Every governance decision is recorded to an append-only SOA ledger with:
   - Agent identity and trust score
   - Artifact path and risk grade
   - Timestamp and decision rationale

4. **Trust Dynamics** — Agent trust scores evolve based on outcomes:
   - Approved L3 actions → trust increase
   - Rejected or failed actions → trust decrease
   - Trust scores influence future routing decisions

### Why Deterministic Matters

When an LLM is asked to enforce safety rules, it can:

- Reinterpret rules based on context
- Produce inconsistent decisions across similar inputs
- Be influenced by prompt engineering attacks

QoreLogic avoids these risks by executing deterministic TypeScript code at the governance boundary. The policy engine uses simple string matching and path analysis—no LLM inference required for governance decisions.

**Example**: A file containing `api_key` will always trigger L3 classification. No prompt can persuade the code to ignore this trigger.

## Safety Alert

```
FailSafe Blocked: AXIOM 1 VIOLATION: No active Intent exists.
Remediation: Create an Intent before modifying files.

[Create Intent] [View Active Intent]
```

## Features

### 1. Governance Modes

FailSafe now supports three governance modes to match your workflow needs:

| Mode        | Behavior                                                           | Best For                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Observe** | No blocking, just visibility and logging. Zero friction.           | New users, exploration, learning |
| **Assist**  | Smart defaults, auto-intent creation, gentle prompts. Recommended. | Most development workflows       |
| **Enforce** | Full control, intent-gated saves, L3 approvals.                    | Compliance, regulated industries |

Switch modes via:

- Command: `FailSafe: Set Governance Mode`
- Settings: `failsafe.governance.mode`

### 2. Save-Time Governance Gate

FailSafe evaluates save operations against the active Intent and can block writes when no active Intent exists or when a file is out of scope.

### 3. Sentinel Monitoring and Audits

- File watcher queues audits for code changes
- Manual audits via command
- Modes: `heuristic`, `llm-assisted`, `hybrid` (LLM uses the configured endpoint)

### 4. SOA Ledger and L3 Queue

- Append-only ledger database for audit entries
- L3 approvals surfaced in the UI

### 5. UI Screens

- FailSafe Monitor (compact view)
- FailSafe Command Center (extended popout/editor view)
- Skills view now includes `Recommended`, `All Relevant`, `All Installed`, and `Other Available` to keep full skill visibility.

### FailSafe Monitor UI

![FailSafe Monitor UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MythologIQ/FailSafe/main/FailSafe/extension/media/FailSafe-Sidebar.PNG)

### 6. Command Center UX

- Compact `FailSafe Monitor` webpanel (`UI-02`) provides phase status, prioritized feature counters, Sentinel state, and workspace health at-a-glance.
- `Open FailSafe Command Center` opens the extended popout console for deeper workflow views (Overview, Operations, Audit, Risks, Skills, Laws, Mindmap, Config).
- Branding is consistent across shell surfaces, including FailSafe icon usage in header and favicon contexts.
- Optional external Qore runtime integration can display live runtime state, policy version, endpoint, and latency in the compact monitor.

### UI Positioning Model

- Monitor and Command Center roles are defined in the Solution summary above; this model maps those roles to FailSafe architecture.
- Narrative alignment:
  - `Genesis` -> Build
  - `QoreLogic` -> Govern
  - `Sentinel` -> Watch
  - `Command Center` -> Build + Govern
  - `Monitor` -> Watch

### 7. Skill Governance and Provenance

- Installed skills are discovered from FailSafe workspace roots (`FailSafe/VSCode/skills`, `.agent/skills`, `.github/skills`) with project-first precedence.
- Phase-aware relevance ranking returns `recommended`, `allRelevant`, and `otherAvailable` groupings.
- Skill metadata includes provenance fields (creator, source repo/path, source type/priority, admission state, trust tier, version pin).
- `SOURCE.yml` metadata is ingested to preserve attribution and authorship for bundled and imported skills.

### 8. Checkpoint Reliability Backbone

- Checkpoint events are stored in a local SQLite ledger (`failsafe_checkpoints`) with typed events and parent-chain integrity checks.
- Hub APIs expose checkpoint summaries and recent checkpoint history for UI transparency.

### 9. Feedback Capture

- Generate, view, and export feedback snapshots

### 10. QoreLogic Propagation

Supported via internal sync flows when enabled by workspace governance configuration.

### 11. Break-Glass Protocol (v4.1.0)

Emergency governance overrides for time-sensitive situations. Activate via `FailSafe: Activate Break-Glass Override` with a justification (min 10 chars) and duration (15–240 minutes). Auto-reverts on expiry. Full audit trail recorded in the SOA ledger.

### 12. Verdict Replay (v4.1.0)

Re-execute past governance decisions for audit verification via `FailSafe: Replay Verdict (Audit)`. Compares current policy hash and artifact hash against the original decision to detect drift.

### 13. Commit Governance (v4.3.0)

- `FailSafe: Install Commit Hook` writes a thin hook client and per-session token into `.git/`.
- The hook calls `GET /api/v1/governance/commit-check` and only enforces the server's `allow` decision.
- If the local API is unreachable or no token is present, the hook fails open by design. This is an operator guardrail, not a hard security boundary.

### 14. AI Provenance Tracking (v4.3.0)

- Save events can emit `PROVENANCE_RECORDED` ledger entries with artifact path, detected agent type, confidence, and active intent.
- Provenance is observational. It does not mutate source files or inject comments.
- History is queryable through the governance API and visible in local ledger data.

### 15. Multi-Agent Governance Fabric (v4.2.0)

FailSafe detects and governs multiple AI coding assistants in your workspace:

- **Runtime Detection** — Identifies Claude CLI, Copilot, Codex CLI, and Agent Teams via terminal and config scanning.
- **Per-Agent Config Injection** — Writes governance rules into each agent's native format (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.kilocode/rules/`, `codex.md`, `.claude/agents/`).
- **Governance Ceremony** — Single command (`FailSafe: Set Up Agent Governance`) to inject or remove governance across all detected agents.
- **Coverage Dashboard** — Console view showing which agents are detected, governed, and compliant.
- **First-Run Onboarding** — Guides new users through multi-agent governance setup on first activation.

### 16. Intent Schema v2 (v4.2.0)

Intents now carry `schemaVersion`, `agentIdentity` (which agent created the intent and via which workflow), and `planId` references. Legacy v1 intents are auto-migrated on read.

If `.failsafe/config/sentinel.yaml` exists, it overrides settings. The initializer seeds it with `mode: hybrid` unless you change it.

Commit-time governance is available through the local FailSafe API on `http://127.0.0.1:7777` when the optional git hook is installed.

## Workspace Files

FailSafe seeds a `.failsafe/` directory in your workspace for configuration, ledger, and feedback output. The primary workspace config is `.failsafe/config/sentinel.yaml`. Optional policy overrides can be placed at:

- `.failsafe/config/policies/risk_grading.json`
- `.failsafe/config/policies/citation_policy.json`

## Privacy

- Heuristic mode runs locally
- LLM-assisted and hybrid modes call the configured endpoint

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.90.0 or later
- Node.js 18+ (for development)
- `curl` (required only if you install the commit hook)
- Ollama (optional, for LLM-assisted mode)

## Checkpoint Integrity and Local Memory

FailSafe tracks more than Git state. It records governance checkpoints as signed metadata records, then stores Sentinel observations in a local retrieval store so operators can recover the _what_, _why_, and _how_ of runtime decisions.

### Process Reality

1. Git readiness is enforced at bootstrap (`ensureGitRepositoryReady`), including optional auto-install and `git init` when needed.
2. Governance events are checkpointed into `failsafe_checkpoints` with run/phase/status context and deterministic hashes.
3. Each checkpoint carries `git_hash`, `payload_hash`, `entry_hash`, and `prev_hash` so chain integrity can be recomputed.
4. Hub and API surfaces expose both summary and recent checkpoint records for operational visibility.
5. Sentinel writes local memory records to `.failsafe/rag/sentinel-rag.db` (or JSONL fallback), including `payload_json`, `metadata_json`, and retrieval text.

### Technical Advantages

- Tamper evidence via hash-chained checkpoint records.
- Git-linked governance state for repository-correlated audit trails.
- Local-first memory retention for security and low-latency recall.
- Deterministic fallback paths when SQLite is unavailable.
