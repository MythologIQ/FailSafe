# QoreLogic File Structure Standard

**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-03
**Purpose**: Define the standard file structure and organization principles that QoreLogic projects adhere to

---

## Overview

This document defines the expected file structure and organization standards for all QoreLogic projects. These standards ensure consistency, maintainability, and discoverability across all workspaces.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Semantic Grouping**: Files are organized by project/context first, then by type within semantic folders
2. **Conservative Organization**: Preserve existing meaningful structures; don't destroy
3. **Complete Traceability**: Every file movement is logged with start/end positions and timestamps
4. **Documentation-First**: Always document organizational changes in README.md and FILE_INDEX.md
5. **Protected Structures**: Managed project structures are never touched or reorganized

---

## Standard Workspace Structure

### Root Level

```
workspace/
├── Projects/          # Active and completed projects with related files
├── Research/          # Articles, PDFs, and reference materials
├── Data/              # Spreadsheets, CSVs, and datasets
├── Documents/         # Notes, plans, and written content
├── Archive/           # Old or completed items
├── README.md          # Workspace organization guide
└── FILE_INDEX.md      # Complete file movement log (generated by /ql-organize)
```

### Detailed Structure

#### `Projects/`

**Purpose**: Contains active and completed projects with all related files grouped semantically.

**Contents**:

- Project directories with all associated files
- Each project directory should contain all files related to that project
- Projects may have their own subdirectories (e.g., `Projects/MyProject/src/`, `Projects/MyProject/docs/`)

**Example**:

```
Projects/
├── E-Commerce-Platform/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── tests/
│   ├── docs/
│   └── config/
└── Data-Pipeline/
    ├── scripts/
    ├── notebooks/
    └── docs/
```

#### `Research/`

**Purpose**: Contains research materials, articles, PDFs, and reference documents.

**Contents**:

- PDF files
- Research documents
- Reference articles
- External content
- Academic papers

**Example**:

```
Research/
├── Articles/
│   ├── machine-learning-basics.pdf
│   └── architecture-patterns.pdf
├── Papers/
│   └── distributed-systems.pdf
└── References/
    └── api-best-practices.md
```

#### `Data/`

**Purpose**: Contains datasets, spreadsheets, and tabular data.

**Contents**:

- CSV files
- XLSX files
- JSON datasets
- Other tabular data files

**Example**:

```
Data/
├── datasets/
│   ├── training-data.csv
│   └── test-data.csv
├── exports/
│   └── quarterly-report.xlsx
└── backups/
    └── database-dump.json
```

#### `Documents/`

**Purpose**: Contains notes, plans, and written documentation.

**Contents**:

- Markdown files
- Text documents
- Planning documents
- Analysis documents
- Meeting notes

**Example**:

```
Documents/
├── Plans/
│   ├── q1-roadmap.md
│   └── architecture-decision.md
├── Notes/
│   ├── meeting-2024-01-15.md
│   └── brainstorming-session.md
└── Analysis/
    └── performance-review.md
```

#### `Archive/`

**Purpose**: Contains outdated files, deprecated versions, and completed projects.

**Contents**:

- Outdated files
- Deprecated versions
- Completed projects
- Historical data

**Example**:

```
Archive/
├── Deprecated/
│   └── old-api-implementation.js
├── Completed/
│   └── prototype-v1/
└── Historical/
    └── 2023-backup.zip
```

## QoreLogic Framework Structure

### Root Level QoreLogic Directory

```
qorelogic/
├── Claude/              # Claude-specific skills and configurations
├── Antigravity/         # Antigravity-specific skills and configurations
├── Codex/               # Codex-specific skills and configurations
├── Cursor/              # Cursor-specific skills and configurations
├── KiloCode/            # KiloCode-specific skills and configurations
├── VSCode/              # VSCode-specific skills and configurations
├── Zo/                  # Zo-specific skills and configurations
├── CODEX_HANDOFF.md     # Handoff documentation
├── SKILLS_ANALYSIS.md   # Analysis of available skills
├── SKILLS_ENHANCEMENT_SUMMARY.md  # Summary of skill enhancements
└── propagate.ps1        # Propagation script
```

### AI Assistant Subdirectory Structure

Each AI assistant directory stores a **workspace-mirrored bundle**. The bundle should match the target folder that will be synced into a workspace.

```
{assistant}/
├── manifest.json        # Assistant manifest and configuration
├── INSTALL.md           # Installation instructions (optional)
└── <workspace-bundle>/  # The exact workspace layout for this assistant
```

**Examples**

Claude bundle:
```
qorelogic/Claude/
├── manifest.json
├── INSTALL.md
└── .claude/
    ├── commands/
    ├── hooks/
    ├── templates/
    └── docs/
```

Antigravity bundle:
```
qorelogic/Antigravity/
├── manifest.json
├── INSTALL.md
├── .qorelogic/
│   ├── orbits/
│   ├── policies/
│   ├── skills/
│   ├── templates/
│   └── docs/
└── .agent/
    └── workflows/
```

VS Code bundle:
```
qorelogic/VSCode/
├── manifest.json
└── .failsafe/
    └── config/
        ├── policies/
        └── templates/
```

---

## Protected Directory Patterns

The following directory patterns are **never** touched or reorganized:

1. **Directories containing `*` files**: Managed project structures
2. **`Articles/` directories**: Preserved as managed content
3. **`Prompts/` directories**: Preserved as managed content
4. **Version control directories**: `.git/`, `.svn/`, etc.
5. **IDE configuration directories**: `.vscode/`, `.idea/`, etc.
6. **Node modules**: `node_modules/`
7. **Build artifacts**: `dist/`, `build/`, `out/`
8. **Dependency directories**: `vendor/`, `third_party/`

---

## File Naming Conventions

### General Rules

1. **Use lowercase letters**: `my-file.md` (not `My-File.md`)
2. **Use hyphens for spaces**: `project-plan.md` (not `project_plan.md` or `projectPlan.md`)
3. **Be descriptive**: `user-authentication-service.ts` (not `auth.ts`)
4. **Avoid special characters**: Only use letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores
5. **Use consistent extensions**: `.md` for Markdown, `.ts` for TypeScript, etc.

### Specific Patterns

| Pattern               | Example                | Description             |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `{name}-{type}.{ext}` | `user-service.ts`      | Service files           |
| `{name}-test.{ext}`   | `auth-service.test.ts` | Test files              |
| `{name}-spec.{ext}`   | `api-client.spec.ts`   | Specification files     |
| `{name}-config.{ext}` | `database-config.json` | Configuration files     |
| `{name}-README.md`    | `project-README.md`    | Project-specific README |

---

## Organization Workflow

### Using `/ql-organize`

When organizing a workspace:

1. **Assess**: Catalog loose files and identify semantic relationships
2. **Identify**: Determine semantic grouping opportunities
3. **Protect**: Identify and preserve managed structures
4. **Create**: Establish organized folder structure
5. **Consolidate**: Move files to semantic directories
6. **Document**: Generate FILE_INDEX.md and update README.md
7. **Verify**: Ensure no loose files remain

### Manual Organization

When manually organizing files:

1. Follow the standard workspace structure
2. Group files semantically by project/context
3. Document all movements in FILE_INDEX.md
4. Update README.md with new structure
5. Preserve protected directories
6. Use consistent naming conventions

---

## Traceability Requirements

### File Movement Logging

Every file movement must be logged with:

- **Original path**: Where the file started
- **New path**: Where the file ended
- **File type**: File extension
- **Timestamp**: ISO 8601 format
- **Rationale**: Why the file was moved to that location

### Audit Trail

Maintain a complete audit trail of all organizational changes:

1. **FILE_INDEX.md**: Complete movement log
2. **README.md**: Current structure documentation
3. **META_LEDGER.md**: If present, update with organizational changes

---

## Compliance Checklist

A workspace is compliant with QoreLogic file structure standards when:

- [ ] All loose files are organized into semantic directories
- [ ] No files remain in workspace root (except standard files)
- [ ] README.md documents the current structure
- [ ] FILE_INDEX.md exists with complete movement log
- [ ] All file movements are logged with start/end positions
- [ ] All movements include timestamps
- [ ] Protected directories are documented
- [ ] Manual decisions are documented
- [ ] Managed project structures are preserved
- [ ] Files are grouped by project/context, not just type
- [ ] File naming conventions are followed
- [ ] Documentation is up-to-date
