- Multi-workspace server registry for independent FailSafe instances across VS Code windows.
- Compliance metric in Monitor UI with grade display and violation tooltips.
- S.H.I.E.L.D. phase tracker parsing META_LEDGER.md for governance state awareness.

- Dynamic port propagation replaces hardcoded 9376.

## [4.6.5] - 2026-03-10

### Changed

- Cross-agent skill consolidation: 200+ files across 7 locations → canonical `.claude/skills/` + `.claude/agents/` + automated transpilation.
- Skills migrated from flat `.claude/commands/ql-*.md` to directory-based `.claude/skills/ql-*/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter.
- Agent definitions separated to `.claude/agents/ql-*.md` with subagent frontmatter.
- ModelAdapter output directories corrected for Claude, Codex, Gemini, Copilot, and Cursor.
- VSIX bundling de-complected: agents removed from skill pipeline, directory-based patterns added.
- Antigravity restructured from Genesis/Qorelogic to skills/agents layout.
- `FailSafe/Claude/` (20 stale duplicate files) deleted.
- 12 quarantined skills cleaned up (9 superseded removed, 3 archived).
- `AGENTS.md` created at repo root for cross-agent compatibility.

## [4.6.4] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed

- Trust state was transient: event-driven invalidation via EventBus replaces stale init-only cache. Mutations persist to SQLite and cache rebuilds from DB on trust updates, quarantines, and releases.
- Trust timestamps fabricated: `getTrustScore()` now returns DB `updated_at` instead of `new Date()`. Audit trails reflect real mutation times.
- Checkpoint chain validity assumed on startup: now auto-verified during initialization; failures recorded.
- Command Center version hardcoded to 4.4.0: now reads from package.json.

### Added

- Trust persistence with optimistic locking, version-based concurrency control, and exponential backoff retry for concurrent agent trust updates.
- Three trust event types (`trustUpdated`, `agentQuarantined`, `agentReleased`) for EventBus cache invalidation.

### Changed

- TrustEngine decomposed: 449L → 3 files (223L + 167L + 40L) for Section 4 compliance.

## [4.6.3] - 2026-03-08

Incremental hotfix for Monitor & Command Center parity. Further refinements forthcoming.

### Fixed

- Console Server `express.static` missing `dotfiles: "allow"` — all CSS/JS/image assets silently 404'd under dotfile install paths.
- Monitor sidebar: active build/debug session tracking via IDE lifecycle events.
- "Recently Completed" falls through to checkpoint history when plan data is empty.
- L3 approval queue auto-prunes expired items on read (SLA enforcement).
- Command Center: verdict alert banner, live network activity, verdict-aware mission strip.
- XSS hardening on Command Center overview innerHTML interpolations.

## [4.6.2] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed

- Console Server 404 on dotfile install paths (`.vscode/`, `.antigravity/`). Latent bug in Express `sendFile()` dotfile protection.

## [4.6.1] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed

- Missing sidebar SVG icon in activity bar.
- Release Pipeline branch policy validation for tag-based CI.
- Icon reference validation added to release preflight gate.

## [4.6.0] - 2026-03-08

### Changed

- Section 4 Razor decomposition: ConsoleServer 3265L→1124L, stt-engine 400L→249L, EnforcementEngine 250L→122L with 16 extracted modules.
- Voice brainstorm bug fixes: rAF batching, TTS error handling, node taxonomy, waveform visualizer, truncation logging (B119, B120, B125, B129, B132).
- Hook toggle UI and release gate enhancements (B107, B108, B138, B139).
- Socket.dev compliance: deprecated API removal, post-build pattern sanitization.
- Governance doc storage migrated to `.failsafe/governance/`.

## [4.5.1] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed

- Activation crash when ledger database is unavailable
- CI validator parameter mismatch in `validate.ps1`

## [4.5.0] - 2026-03-07

---

## [4.4.1] - 2026-03-06

### Changed

- Extension activation now uses explicit command/view/chat activation events instead of startup-wide activation.
- Socket policy manifests updated to ignore accepted capability classes used by design.
- Socket badge/version markers aligned to `4.4.1` across docs.

---

## [4.4.0] - 2026-03-06

---

## [4.3.2] - 2026-03-04

> _"Performance & Polish"_

### Changed

- **Checkpoint Integrity Flow** - Full chain verification moved out of heartbeat-critical paths and exposed through explicit verify actions in Console UI.
- **Robust Local Server Startup** - API and roadmap server startup paths now resolve available ports within fallback ranges to reduce activation failures.
- **Message-Driven Webview Refresh** - Transparency and Economics panels now update incrementally via postMessage after initial render.

> _"Security Hardening"_

### Fixed

- **SQL Injection Protection** — `SchemaVersionManager.hasColumn()` now validates table names against a strict whitelist (`shadow_genome`, `schema_version`, `soa_ledger`) before PRAGMA queries, preventing dynamic table name injection.
- **XSS Prevention in LivingGraphTemplate** — Graph tooltip and stats elements now HTML-escape all dynamic node data (`label`, `type`, `state`, `riskGrade`) before rendering. Stats element switched from `innerHTML` to `textContent` for numeric-only content.
- **XSS Prevention in RevertTemplate** — Revert result display now HTML-escapes step status, name, detail, and error messages before innerHTML assignment.
- **README Logo Path** — Corrected logo reference from root `icon.png` to `FailSafe/extension/icon.png` to display the current FailSafe branding.

---

## [4.3.0] - 2026-03-02

> _"Telemetry Loop"_

### Added

- **Pre-Commit Guard** (`failsafe.installCommitHook`, `failsafe.removeCommitHook`) - Installs an authenticated thin-client git hook that queries `GET /api/v1/governance/commit-check` before commit.
- **Provenance Tracking** - Records AI authorship attribution to the SOA ledger as `PROVENANCE_RECORDED` events and exposes artifact history via `GET /api/v1/governance/provenance/:artifactPath`.
- **CI Governance Context Export** - Adds `tools/export-governance-context.sh` and release workflow artifact upload so shipped builds retain public governance context.

### Changed

- Release documentation, README surfaces, and packaged extension metadata now align on `v4.3.0`.
- Bundled extension operator docs now ship with the VSIX for component-level and process-level guidance.

### Fixed

- Quality sweep remediation sealed for `v4.3.0`: IPv6 SSRF coverage in `GovernanceWebhook`, dead-code removal in `capabilities.ts`, and Razor compliance restoration in `SentinelRagStore.ts`.

## [4.2.0] - 2026-02-27
