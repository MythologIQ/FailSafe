# Concept: The Ripple Viewer (Visualizing Consequence)

**Context**: A Code Deviation is not an isolated event; it is a stone thrown into a pond.
**Goal**: Visually demonstrate the "Blast Radius" of a deviation to empower informed decision-making. (Timeline, Effort, Dependencies).

## 1. The Mechanic: "The Ghost Graph"

We utilize the **Genesis Mind Map** (Mermaid.js) to show a comparative state.

### Layer 1: The Reality (What Was)

- The original Spec/Plan Graph.
- Nodes are stable (Blue).

### Layer 2: The Deviation (What Is Proposed)

- The "Ghost Nodes" generated by the Viability Assessment.
- **Visual Language**:
  - **New Dependencies**: Dotted Orange Lines. ("This change forces Module B to refactor").
  - **Timeline Shift**: Nodes grow in size relative to increased effort estimate.
  - **Broken Links**: Red Crossed Lines. ("This change breaks the API contract with Module C").

## 2. The UX: "The Impact Blast"

When the User views the **Viability Report**, they do not just see text. They see the **Mind Map** with a **"Blast Radius"** overlay.

### Visual Indicators

1.  **The Epicenter**: The node where the code change happened (Pulsing Yellow).
2.  **The Ripples**: Affected dependent tasks Highlighted in Orange.
3.  **The Cost**: A dynamic "Project Health" HUD overlay:
    - **Timeline**: `+2 Days` (Red Arrow Up).
    - **Complexity**: `+15%` (Red Arrow Up).
    - **Risk**: `MEDIUM` -> `HIGH`.

## 3. The Interaction: "Accepting the Ripple"

The User must "Sign Off" on the ripple effects.

- **Slider UI**: "Simulate Scale" (What if we reduce scope? Ripples shrink).
- **Confirmation**: "I accept the +2 Day delay and the refactor of Module B."

## Synergy with Foundation

This validates our previous investment in the **Mind Map Capability**.

- We are not building a new visualization tool.
- We are simply _diffing_ two graphs (Plan vs. Deviation) and rendering the difference.

## Summary

The "Consequence" is no longer abstract paperwork. It is a visual "blood stain" on the clean project map. You can see exactly what you are breaking.
