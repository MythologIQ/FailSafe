# Voice Brainstorm Specification

Status Date: 2026-03-04  
Target Track: `v4.3.2`

## 1. Purpose

Document the shipped Brainstorm voice architecture and clearly separate it from future enhancements.

## 2. Current Reality (`v4.3.2`)

Shipped Brainstorm capabilities:

- microphone-driven voice capture in Console Brainstorm tab
- STT pipeline in browser via `SttEngine` (`whisper` primary, Web Speech fallback)
- transcript submission to backend extraction route
- backend graph extraction + event broadcast
- confidence-colored nodes and force-directed auto-layout
- TTS spoken response playback via `TtsEngine`
- manual node add/drag/export workflows

Prerequisite:

- vendor runtime assets must be staged under:
  - `FailSafe/extension/src/roadmap/ui/vendor/whisper/`
  - `FailSafe/extension/src/roadmap/ui/vendor/piper/`

## 3. Shipped Interaction Loop

### Phase A: Voice Capture

- User toggles mic button in Brainstorm toolbar.
- Browser captures audio and STT engine emits transcript text.

### Phase B: Transcript to Graph

- Frontend calls `POST /api/v1/brainstorm/transcript`.
- Backend `BrainstormService` extracts nodes/edges/verbal response.
- Console broadcasts `brainstorm.update`.

### Phase C: Visual + Spoken Feedback

- Canvas ingests nodes/edges and applies confidence color.
- Force layout settles new nodes.
- TTS speaks extractor `verbalResponse`.

## 4. API Surface (Shipped)

- `POST /api/v1/brainstorm/transcript` - process transcript and return extraction
- `POST /api/v1/brainstorm/node` - add manual node
- `GET /api/v1/brainstorm/graph` - fetch current graph
- `DELETE /api/v1/brainstorm/graph` - reset graph

## 5. Data Contract

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "n1",
      "label": "Tenant Sharding",
      "type": "Architecture",
      "confidence": 55
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "source": "n1",
      "target": "n2",
      "label": "depends on"
    }
  ],
  "verbalResponse": "I mapped the concept and flagged a governance conflict for review."
}
```

## 6. Forward Scope (Planned)

- optional raw-audio ingestion endpoint (`POST /api/v1/brainstorm/voice`) for server-side STT
- richer node editing/delete/edge authoring UX
- expanded quality telemetry for STT/TTS runtime health

## 9. Next Generation: 3D Spatial Mindmap (v5.0.0 Architecture Addendum)

The 2D SVG `brainstorm-canvas.js` is slated for an upgrade to a fully interactive 3D WebGL experience. This will blend the aesthetic of structured hierarchical mapping with deep multi-dimensional knowledge graphs.

### 9.1 Core Capabilities

- **3D Manipulation Engine**: Users click, drag, and rotate the entire spatial graph mapping. Zooming is granular and supports massive multi-node memory clusters without performance degradation.
- **Underlying Technology Pipeline**: Replaces base SVG with `3d-force-graph` (via Three.js) directly managed inside `brainstorm-canvas.js`. `force-layout.js` handles spatial 3D physics (repulsion, springs).

### 9.2 HUD & GUI Overlays

The design will incorporate the following floating HTML/CSS interface wrappers over the 3D canvas:

1. **View Control Toolbar (Top Center)**: Toggles allowing the user to snap the force-directed graph into specific algorithmic layouts instantly: `[ FORCE ] [ TREE ] [ CIRCLE ] [ GRID ]` or switch between traditional `Graph` and 3D `Spatial`.
2. **Legend & Filter Panel (Bottom Left)**: A dark-glass control panel for live-filtering the graph depth:
   - **Statistics**: Tally of Memories, Documents, Connections.
   - **Relations Toggles**: Show/hide node edges based on type (e.g., `Updates`, `Extends`, `Inferences`, `Doc > Memory`, `Similarity`).
   - **Similarity Toggles**: Show/hide `Strong` vs `Weak` associative links.
3. **Context Menus (On Node Click)**: Holographic pop-over cards displaying metadata, sub-cluster counts, and actions (`Go to document`, `Next memory`, `Prev memory`).

### 9.3 Node & Edge Morphology

- **Cluster Spheres**: High-level nodes render as translucent spheres indicating they contain sub-trees (e.g., displaying "4 ideas").
- **Atomic Nodes**: Individual memories or concepts render as hard geometric points with glowing rings indicative of their viability (Green, Yellow, Orange, Red) from the STT extraction constraints.
- **Directional Particles**: Instead of static SVG lines for edges, relationships will feature subtle animated particles traveling along the links to show data/memory flow between components.

### 9.4 Audio Data Retention, Privacy & Playback

Voice-captured audio is a highly sensitive telemetry stream. The system must enforce strict privacy controls and storage mechanisms:

- **Private Storage Directory**: Raw `.webm` (or `.wav`) voice captures must be saved strictly to a `PRIVATE(FailSafe)` local folder inside the workspace. This directory is defined as `.failsafe/audio/` and is automatically injected into `.gitignore` during the `/ql-bootstrap` workflow. **No audio files will ever be committed to the repo.**
- **Cryptographic Filenames & Deduplication**: To prevent duplicates and expose a deterministic reference, audio files are saved using a hashed GUID (e.g., `SHA256(audioData + timestamp)`).
- **Embedded Metadata**: Alongside the raw audio, a parallel `.json` file or SQLite entry will store the metadata payload:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "hash123...",
    "timestamp": "2026-03-04T12:00:00Z",
    "topics": ["database", "sharding", "risk"],
    "durationMs": 4500,
    "transcript": "Let's redesign the core database..."
  }
  ```
- **Retention & Playback GUI**: The Brainstorm HUD (or `Settings` tab) will feature an **Audio Management Element**:
  - **Retention Controls**: A selector allowing users to set auto-purge policies (e.g. `Purge after 24 hours`, `Purge after 7 days`, `Keep forever`).
  - **Playback Scrubbing**: An embedded audio player bound to nodes. When a user selects a voice-generated node on the 3D map, the Context Menu will feature a "Play Original Audio" button, allowing them to hear their exact spoken dictation alongside the LLM's abstraction.

### 9.5 The Ideation Prep Bay (Staging Area)

To prevent overwhelming the 3D Mindmap with fragmented or accidental logic, voice captures and manual entries will first enter an **Ideation Prep Bay** rather than being instantly injected into the physics graph.

#### Layout & Workflow:

1. **The Staging Canvas**: A dedicated, sleek "HUD Panel" sitting above the 3D map (or accessible via a toggle). It features a large text area (`What's on your mind? Add ideas, questions, or goals...`).
2. **Recording Controls (Right Panel)**:
   - A prominent `[ RECORD ]` button. When pressed, the user can speak freely.
   - The STT Engine transcribes the audio in real-time directly into the Staging Canvas. Users can mentally prepare multiple ideations within a single continuous thought, pause, and manually edit the transcript.
   - A distinct `[ SEND TO MIND MAP ]` button. This triggers the QoreLogic LLM extraction. Only upon pressing this do the concepts become atomic 3D nodes.
3. **Recent Thoughts Ledger**:
   - Alongside the Staging Canvas is a dropdown or list (e.g., `0 thoughts`) functioning as a localized history cache.
   - It displays timestamps and short snippets of the last 5-10 submitted thoughts, allowing the user to seamlessly pick up where they left off without needing to scan the massive 3D architecture.
4. **State Indicators**: The footer of the Prep Bay clearly telegraphs the background agents: `• AI analyzing connections...` or `• Checking integrity...`.

### 9.6 Mental Haptic Feedback & Autonomous Ideation

The 3D Mindmap is not a passive whiteboard. It is a living, reactive entity that provides "mental haptic feedback" through the physical mutation of its graph nodes, allowing users to intuitively _feel_ the health of their architectural landscape at a glance.

#### Emergent Visual Morphology (Immediate Implementation):

1. **Gravitational Emphasis (Mass/Size Caching)**: When an idea, entity, or feature is repeatedly mentioned across multiple Brainstorm sessions, its underlying node **grows in physical size and mass**. High-gravity nodes will naturally warp the force-directed layout, pulling dependent concepts into a tighter orbit and visually indicating core structural load-bearing components.
2. **Ambiguity Dilution (Visual Strain)**: If a single concept becomes overloaded with too many disparate, conflicting, or loosely-defined connections (e.g., 50 different "Question" or "Orange" nodes attached to a single "Database" node), it undergoes visual strain. The node will pulse irregularly, its edges will fray, and its sphere will become cloudy/diluted—signaling that this architectural piece is bloated and requires refactoring or clarification.
3. **The 'Outer Rim' Isolation**: Radical, unconnected "what if" thoughts do not snap to the core S.H.I.E.L.D. logic center. They are pushed by algorithmic repulsion to the outer rim of the 3D void. However, as more isolated thoughts are dumped over time, the algorithm watches for latent similarities. If remote thoughts begin to overlap in semantic intent, they will inherently drift together, **forming new geometric shapes/clusters** on the fringes.

#### System-Initiated Autonomy (Later Free Versions):

As these fringe clusters form or core nodes undergo "Ambiguity Dilution," FailSafe transitions from a reactive mapper to a proactive architect. This logic is slated for a future free update.

- **Targeted Brainstorm Prompts**: The Console will flag emerging patterns and organically prompt the user via the Prep Bay: _"I notice a strong cluster forming around isolated auth logic. Shall we initiate a targeted Brainstorm to solidify this into a formal Auth Service?"_
- **Autonomous System Ideation**: In advanced iterations, FailSafe will spawn its own background sub-agents. While the user is offline or working elsewhere, the system will independently analyze strained nodes or isolated clusters, run its own "synthetic brainstorms" in the background, and dynamically populate the graph with its own generated nodes (distinctly colored, e.g., Purple or Blue) presenting fully-formed, S.H.I.E.L.D.-compliant solutions for the user's review upon their return.
