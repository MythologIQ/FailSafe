# Concept: The Concept Manifest (The Output)

**Context**: We know _how_ to ideate (FailSafe Method), but what do we hold in our hands when we are done?
**Goal**: Define the tangible Deliverable and the Gate Criteria for the Concept Phase.

---

## 1. The Output: "The Concept Manifest"

The output is NOT just a `concept.json` file. It is a human-readable Artifact called the **Concept Manifest**.
It is the "Movie Poster" for the feature.

### Components of the Manifest

1.  **The Strategic Anchors** (from DeepWisdom):
    - **The Pain**: (e.g., "Hallucination breeds distrust").
    - **The Value**: (e.g., "Documentation Tax enforces process").
2.  **The Soul Narrative** (from FailSafe Method):
    - **The Immersion**: "I am sitting at a heavy steel desk..."
    - **The Tools**: "I hold a caliper and a stamp..."
3.  **The Visual Artifact** (New Requirement):
    - A **Generated Image** (or reference) that captures the "Vibe/Workspace" described in the Immersion step.
    - _Why?_ "A picture is worth 1000 specs."

## 2. The Maturity Gate: "Are we ready for Design?"

How do we know if the Manifest is "Matured"? We apply the **Resonance Test**.

### Criteria 1: The Clarity Threshold

The System analyzes the text of the "Pain" and "Value".

- **Weak**: "Users are confused." (Vague).
- **Matured**: "Users lose 4 hours/week debugging hallucinated imports." (Specific).

### Criteria 2: The Alignment Check

Does the **Visual Artifact** match the **Soul Narrative**?

- If the text says "Cyberpunk" but the image looks like "Corporate Memphis", the Concept is **Immature (Conflicted)**.

### Criteria 3: The "Stranger Test" (Simulated)

The Agent simulates a "Stranger Persona".

- **Action**: The Stranger reads the Manifest and attempts to describe the feature back to the User.
- **Pass**: The Stranger's description matches the User's intent.
- **Fail**: The Stranger reconstructs a different idea. -> **Loop back to Ideation**.

---

## Summary

The Output is a **Manifest** (Text + Image).
The Gate is a **Resonance Test** (Specificty + Alignment + Communicability).
You cannot move to Blueprint (Design) until the "Stranger" understands your idea without you explaining it.
